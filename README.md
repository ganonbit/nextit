# Nextit - Next with Apollo Server and Client Auth

[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/client/) is a GraphQL client that allows you to easily query the exact data you need from a GraphQL server. In addition to fetching and mutating data, Apollo analyzes your queries and their results to construct a client-side cache of your data, which is kept up to date as further queries and mutations are run.

In this simple example, we integrate Apollo seamlessly with [Next.js data fetching methods](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) to fetch queries in the server and hydrate them in the browser.
